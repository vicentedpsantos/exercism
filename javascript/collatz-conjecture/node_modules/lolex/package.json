  "readme": "# Lolex [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sinonjs/lolex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sinonjs/lolex)\n\nJavaScript implementation of the timer APIs; `setTimeout`, `clearTimeout`, `setImmediate`, `clearImmediate`, `setInterval`, `clearInterval`, `requestAnimationFrame`, `cancelAnimationFrame`, `requestIdleCallback`, and `cancelIdleCallback`, along with a clock instance that controls the flow of time. Lolex also provides a `Date` implementation that gets its time from the clock.\n\nIn addition in browser environment lolex provides a `performance` implementation that gets its time from the clock. In Node environments lolex provides a `nextTick` implementation that is synchronized with the clock - and a `process.hrtime` shim that works with the clock.\n\nLolex can be used to simulate passing time in automated tests and other\nsituations where you want the scheduling semantics, but don't want to actually\nwait (however, from version 2.0 lolex supports those of you who would like to wait too).\n\nLolex is extracted from [Sinon.JS](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon.js) and targets the [same runtimes](https://sinonjs.org/releases/latest/#supported-runtimes).\n\n## Installation\n\nLolex can be used in both Node and browser environments. Installation is as easy as\n\n```sh\nnpm install lolex\n```\n\nIf you want to use Lolex in a browser you can use [the pre-built\nversion](https://github.com/sinonjs/lolex/blob/master/lolex.js) available in the repo\nand the npm package. Using npm you only need to reference `./node_modules/lolex/lolex.js` in your `<script>` tags.\n\nYou are always free to [build it yourself](https://github.com/sinonjs/lolex/blob/53ea4d9b9e5bcff53cc7c9755dc9aa340368cf1c/package.json#L22), of course.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use lolex, create a new clock, schedule events on it using the timer\nfunctions and pass time using the `tick` method.\n\n```js\n// In the browser distribution, a global `lolex` is already available\nvar lolex = require(\"lolex\");\nvar clock = lolex.createClock();\n\nclock.setTimeout(function () {\n    console.log(\"The poblano is a mild chili pepper originating in the state of Puebla, Mexico.\");\n}, 15);\n\n// ...\n\nclock.tick(15);\n```\n\nUpon executing the last line, an interesting fact about the\n[Poblano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poblano) will be printed synchronously to\nthe screen. If you want to simulate asynchronous behavior, you have to use your\nimagination when calling the various functions.\n\nThe `next`, `runAll`, `runToFrame`, and `runToLast` methods are available to advance the clock. See the\nAPI Reference for more details.\n\n### Faking the native timers\n\nWhen using lolex to test timers, you will most likely want to replace the native\ntimers such that calling `setTimeout` actually schedules a callback with your\nclock instance, not the browser's internals.\n\nCalling `install` with no arguments achieves this. You can call `uninstall`\nlater to restore things as they were again.\n\n```js\n// In the browser distribution, a global `lolex` is already available\nvar lolex = require(\"lolex\");\n\nvar clock = lolex.install();\n// Equivalent to\n// var clock = lolex.install(typeof global !== \"undefined\" ? global : window);\n\nsetTimeout(fn, 15); // Schedules with clock.setTimeout\n\nclock.uninstall();\n// setTimeout is restored to the native implementation\n```\n\nTo hijack timers in another context pass it to the `install` method.\n\n```js\nvar lolex = require(\"lolex\");\nvar context = {\n    setTimeout: setTimeout // By default context.setTimeout uses the global setTimeout\n}\nvar clock = lolex.install({target: context});\n\ncontext.setTimeout(fn, 15); // Schedules with clock.setTimeout\n\nclock.uninstall();\n// context.setTimeout is restored to the original implementation\n```\n\nUsually you want to install the timers onto the global object, so call `install`\nwithout arguments.\n\n#### Automatically incrementing mocked time\nSince version 2.0 Lolex supports the possibility to attach the faked timers\nto any change in the real system time. This basically means you no longer need\nto `tick()` the clock in a situation where you won't know **when** to call `tick()`.\n\nPlease note that this is achieved using the original setImmediate() API at a certain\nconfigurable interval `config.advanceTimeDelta` (default: 20ms). Meaning time would\nbe incremented every 20ms, not in real time.\n\nAn example would be:\n\n```js\nvar lolex = require(\"lolex\");\nvar clock = lolex.install({shouldAdvanceTime: true, advanceTimeDelta: 40});\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n    console.log('this just timed out'); //executed after 40ms\n}, 30);\n\nsetImmediate(() => {\n    console.log('not so immediate'); //executed after 40ms\n});\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n    console.log('this timed out after'); //executed after 80ms\n    clock.uninstall();\n}, 50);\n```\n\n## API Reference\n\n### `var clock = lolex.createClock([now[, loopLimit]])`\n\nCreates a clock. The default\n[epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_%28reference_date%29) is `0`.\n\nThe `now` argument may be a number (in milliseconds) or a Date object.\n\nThe `loopLimit` argument sets the maximum number of timers that will be run when calling `runAll()` before assuming that we have an infinite loop and throwing an error. The default is `1000`.\n\n### `var clock = lolex.install([config])`\nInstalls lolex using the specified config (otherwise with epoch `0` on the global scope). The following configuration options are available\n\nParameter | Type | Default | Description\n--------- | ---- | ------- | ------------\n`config.target`| Object | global | installs lolex onto the specified target context\n`config.now` | Number/Date | 0 | installs lolex with the specified unix epoch\n`config.toFake` | String[] | [\"setTimeout\", \"clearTimeout\", \"setImmediate\", \"clearImmediate\",\"setInterval\", \"clearInterval\", \"Date\", \"requestAnimationFrame\", \"cancelAnimationFrame\", \"requestIdleCallback\", \"cancelIdleCallback\", \"hrtime\"] | an array with explicit function names to hijack. *When not set, lolex will automatically fake all methods **except** `nextTick`* e.g., `lolex.install({ toFake: [\"setTimeout\",\"nextTick\"]})` will fake only `setTimeout` and `nextTick`\n`config.loopLimit` | Number | 1000 | the maximum number of timers that will be run when calling runAll()\n`config.shouldAdvanceTime` | Boolean | false | tells lolex to increment mocked time automatically based on the real system time shift (e.g. the mocked time will be incremented by 20ms for every 20ms change in the real system time)\n`config.advanceTimeDelta` | Number | 20 | relevant only when using with `shouldAdvanceTime: true`. increment mocked time by `advanceTimeDelta` ms every `advanceTimeDelta` ms change in the real system time.\n\n### `var id = clock.setTimeout(callback, timeout)`\n\nSchedules the callback to be fired once `timeout` milliseconds have ticked by.\n\nIn Node.js `setTimeout` returns a timer object. Lolex will do the same, however\nits `ref()` and `unref()` methods have no effect.\n\nIn browsers a timer ID is returned.\n\n### `clock.clearTimeout(id)`\n\nClears the timer given the ID or timer object, as long as it was created using\n`setTimeout`.\n\n### `var id = clock.setInterval(callback, timeout)`\n\nSchedules the callback to be fired every time `timeout` milliseconds have ticked\nby.\n\nIn Node.js `setInterval` returns a timer object. Lolex will do the same, however\nits `ref()` and `unref()` methods have no effect.\n\nIn browsers a timer ID is returned.\n\n### `clock.clearInterval(id)`\n\nClears the timer given the ID or timer object, as long as it was created using\n`setInterval`.\n\n### `var id = clock.setImmediate(callback)`\n\nSchedules the callback to be fired once `0` milliseconds have ticked by. Note\nthat you'll still have to call `clock.tick()` for the callback to fire. If\ncalled during a tick the callback won't fire until `1` millisecond has ticked\nby.\n\nIn Node.js `setImmediate` returns a timer object. Lolex will do the same,\nhowever its `ref()` and `unref()` methods have no effect.\n\nIn browsers a timer ID is returned.\n\n### `clock.clearImmediate(id)`\n\nClears the timer given the ID or timer object, as long as it was created using\n`setImmediate`.\n\n### `clock.requestAnimationFrame(callback)`\n\nSchedules the callback to be fired on the next animation frame, which runs every\n16 ticks. Returns an `id` which can be used to cancel the callback. This is\navailable in both browser & node environments.\n\n### `clock.cancelAnimationFrame(id)`\n\nCancels the callback scheduled by the provided id.\n\n### `clock.requestIdleCallback(callback[, timeout])`\n\nQueued the callback to be fired during idle periods to perform background and low priority work on the main event loop. Callbacks which have a timeout option will be fired no later than time in milliseconds. Returns an `id` which can be used to cancel the callback.\n\n### `clock.cancelIdleCallback(id)`\n\nCancels the callback scheduled by the provided id.\n\n### `clock.countTimers()`\n\nReturns the number of waiting timers. This can be used to assert that a test\nfinishes without leaking any timers.\n\n### `clock.hrtime(prevTime?)`\nOnly available in Node.js, mimicks process.hrtime().\n\n### `clock.nextTick(callback)`\n\nOnly available in Node.js, mimics `process.nextTick` to enable completely synchronous testing flows.\n\n### `clock.performance.now()`\nOnly available in browser environments, mimicks performance.now().\n\n\n### `clock.tick(time)` / `await clock.tickAsync(time)`\n\nAdvance the clock, firing callbacks if necessary. `time` may be the number of\nmilliseconds to advance the clock by or a human-readable string. Valid string\nformats are `\"08\"` for eight seconds, `\"01:00\"` for one minute and `\"02:34:10\"`\nfor two hours, 34 minutes and ten seconds.\n\nThe `tickAsync()` will also break the event loop, allowing any scheduled promise \ncallbacks to execute _before_ running the timers.\n\n### `clock.next()` / `await clock.nextAsync()`\n\nAdvances the clock to the the moment of the first scheduled timer, firing it.\n\nThe `nextAsync()` will also break the event loop, allowing any scheduled promise \ncallbacks to execute _before_ running the timers.\n\n### `clock.reset()`\n\nRemoves all timers and ticks without firing them, and sets `now` to `config.now`\nthat was provided to `lolex.install` or to `0` if `config.now` was not provided.\nUseful to reset the state of the clock without having to `uninstall` and `install` it.\n\n### `clock.runAll()` / `await clock.runAllAsync()`\n\nThis runs all pending timers until there are none remaining. If new timers are added while it is executing they will be run as well.\n\nThis makes it easier to run asynchronous tests to completion without worrying about the number of timers they use, or the delays in those timers.\n\nIt runs a maximum of `loopLimit` times after which it assumes there is an infinite loop of timers and throws an error.\n\nThe `runAllAsync()` will also break the event loop, allowing any scheduled promise \ncallbacks to execute _before_ running the timers.\n\n### `clock.runMicrotasks()`\n\nThis runs all pending microtasks scheduled with `nextTick` but none of the timers and is mostly useful for libraries using lolex underneath and for running `nextTick` items without any timers.\n\n### `clock.runToFrame()`\n\nAdvances the clock to the next frame, firing all scheduled animation frame callbacks,\nif any, for that frame as well as any other timers scheduled along the way.\n\n### `clock.runToLast()` / `await clock.runToLastAsync()`\n\nThis takes note of the last scheduled timer when it is run, and advances the\nclock to that time firing callbacks as necessary.\n\nIf new timers are added while it is executing they will be run only if they\nwould occur before this time.\n\nThis is useful when you want to run a test to completion, but the test recursively\nsets timers that would cause `runAll` to trigger an infinite loop warning.\n\nThe `runToLastAsync()` will also break the event loop, allowing any scheduled promise \ncallbacks to execute _before_ running the timers.\n\n### `clock.setSystemTime([now])`\n\nThis simulates a user changing the system clock while your program is running.\nIt affects the current time but it does not in itself cause e.g. timers to fire;\nthey will fire exactly as they would have done without the call to\nsetSystemTime().\n\n### `clock.uninstall()`\n\nRestores the original methods on the `target` that was passed to\n`lolex.install`, or the native timers if no `target` was given.\n\n### `Date`\n\nImplements the `Date` object but using the clock to provide the correct time.\n\n### `Performance`\n\nImplements the `now` method of the [`Performance`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now) object but using the clock to provide the correct time. Only available in environments that support the Performance object (browsers mostly).\n\n### `lolex.withGlobal`\n\nIn order to support creating clocks based on separate or sandboxed environments (such as JSDOM), Lolex exports a factory method which takes single argument `global`, which it inspects to figure out what to mock and what features to support. When invoking this function with a global, you will get back an object with `timers`, `createClock` and `install` - same as the regular Lolex exports only based on the passed in global instead of the global environment.\n\n## Running tests\n\nLolex has a comprehensive test suite. If you're thinking of contributing bug\nfixes or suggesting new features, you need to make sure you have not broken any\ntests. You are also expected to add tests for any new behavior.\n\n### On node:\n\n```sh\nnpm test\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer more verbose output:\n\n```\n$(npm bin)/mocha ./test/lolex-test.js\n```\n\n### In the browser\n\n[Mochify](https://github.com/mantoni/mochify.js) is used to run the tests in\nPhantomJS. Make sure you have `phantomjs` installed. Then:\n\n```sh\nnpm test-headless\n```\n\n## License\n\nBSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License  (see LICENSE file)\n",
